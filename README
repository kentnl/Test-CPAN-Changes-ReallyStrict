NAME
    Test::CPAN::Changes::ReallyStrict - Ensure a Changes file looks exactly
    like it would if it was machine generated.

VERSION
    version 1.000000

SYNOPSIS
      use Test::More;
      eval 'use Test::CPAN::Changes::ReallyStrict';
      plan skip_all => 'Test::CPAN::Changes::ReallyStrict required for this test' if $@;
      changes_ok();
      done_testing();

DESCRIPTION
    This module is for people who want their Changes file to be 1:1
    Identical to how it would be if they'd generated it programmatically
    with CPAN::Changes.

    This is not for the faint of heart, and will whine about even minor
    changes of white-space.

    You are also at upstream's mercy as to what a changes file looks like,
    and in order to keep this test happy, you'll have to update your whole
    changes file if upstream changes how they format things.
